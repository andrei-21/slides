** Get to Know Each Other
** You
- where are you *from*?

- what is your favorite *way to catch up* with bitcoin development?
- ...
** Warm Up
#+begin_notes
- ask question as we go
- to make it interactive

- who read the bitcoin standard
- who runs a bitcoin core node, how?
- who runs a lightning node, how?

- current block reward
- what is max number of bitcoin, why? 
- next halving
- what is coinbase
- the genesis block creation time

- where is Merkel root for witness transactions placed
- what is the name of the curve for ECDSA
- the last block was mined 9 minutes ago, what is the expected time for the next block to be mined

*** Examples
- BDK [[https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-ffi/blob/master/bdk-ffi/src/bdk.udl][bdk.udl]]
- LDK Node [[https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node/blob/main/bindings/ldk_node.udl][ldk_node.udl]]
- Breez SDK [[https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/blob/main/libs/sdk-bindings/src/breez_sdk.udl][breez_sdk.udl]]
- LipaLightningLib [[https://github.com/getlipa/lipa-lightning-lib/blob/main-breez/src/lipalightninglib.udl][lipalightninglib.udl]]
*** Limitations
- no async
- where to put documentation
*** Questions
** Seminar
*** Guess the Number
A CLI game to guess the number
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./guess
>> help
...
>> start 1 30
I selected a secret number between 1 and 30. Your guess...
>> 3
My number is greater than 3
>> 21
Congrats! My secret number was 21
You took 2 attempts to find out my number.
>> quit
#+END_SRC
*** Make Sure To
- develop unit tests
- =cargo fmt=
- =cargo clippy=
*** Libraries for CLI
- colors with https://docs.rs/colored
- Readline for Rust https://docs.rs/rustyline
  - completions
  - hints
  - history
- progress bar https://docs.rs/indicatif
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- CLI apps are very helpful for examples or prototypes
- Try to make it generic such that you can reuse it in LDK, Breez SDK sessions
#+END_NOTES
*** Let's Start
#+begin_src sh
$ cargo new guess
     Created binary (application) `guess` package
$ cd guess/
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
$ cargo add colored
#+end_src
